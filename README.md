## 🖼️ My BPMN Work

I have created a **Business Process Model (BPMN diagram)** for the Glamify project. The diagram illustrates how different stakeholders - users, suppliers, and brand owners - interact with the Glamify platform, covering key processes such as registration, browsing, purchasing, payment, inventory management, and feedback collection. By mapping these workflows, I demonstrate not only my technical BPMN skills but also my capacity to analyze business contexts, identify assumptions, and design efficient, user-centric solutions.

Here is the BPMN diagram:

## 🔎 Deeper Analysis

Glamify addresses several pain points in the current online fashion industry:

- **User Experience Gap**  
  Existing platforms often lack personalization and interactivity. Glamify’s virtual try-on and tailored recommendations bridge this gap, making shopping more engaging and confidence-building.

- **Supplier Efficiency**  
  Suppliers struggle with fragmented inventory systems. Glamify integrates stock management, pricing updates, and order fulfilment into one streamlined process.

- **Brand Differentiation**  
  Brand owners need more than just a storefront. Glamify provides multimedia content tools, promotional campaigns, and direct communication channels to strengthen brand identity.

- **Community & Feedback Loop**  
  Glamify encourages user reviews, ratings, and feedback, creating a continuous improvement cycle that benefits both consumers and businesses.

## 🎯 Why BPMN Matters Here

Business Process Modelling (BPMN) is critical to Glamify’s success because it:
- Maps out **user journeys** (registration, browsing, purchasing, feedback).  
- Defines **supplier workflows** (inventory updates, order fulfilment, logistics).  
- Illustrates **brand owner processes** (product showcasing, promotions, customer engagement).  
- Ensures **collaboration between stakeholders** is logical, efficient, and scalable.  

By modelling these processes, Glamify can anticipate bottlenecks, validate assumptions, and design a platform that is both **user-centric** and **operationally robust**.
